            <h2>An open-source tool to generate immersive stories from data</h2>
            <p>Dataverse is an open platform built on top of WebVR technologies that helps you build immersive experiences based on Google Sheets.
                No coding required. You can split your interactive experience into scenes ('tabs' in the spreadsheet) that link to each other. For
                each scene you can choose from the several <a href="">visualization types</a> available, including maps, treemaps, timelines and of course,
                360 photos and videos. Once you have written down your spreadsheet, you can <a href="">paste it</a> on the experience generator below, that will generate an url for you and enjoy it.
            The resulting interactive experiences is compatible with the main headsets: HTC Vive, Oculus Rift, Oculus Go, GearVR and Google Cardboard; thanks to WebVR magic.
            You can also have a decent experience navigation on Desktop browsers.</p>
