                <p>Dataverse works with Google Sheets as 'Backend Data'. That means that you can completely define the interactive experience by just filling out a Google Sheet and passing its shared URL to the application. You can read more about the specifics of the Google Sheets format <a href="">here</a>.</p>

                <p>Dataverse is built on <a href="https://aframe.io" target="_blank">AFrame</a>, which in turn is based on <a href="https://webvr.info/" target="_blank">WebVR standards</a>. That means that you can enjoy the generated experience in WebVR compatible devices accessing the exact same URL in a web browser. Dataverse has been tested on Google Cardboard (Chrome browser), HTC Vive and Oculus Rift (Firefox browser) and Oculus Go.</p>

                <p>Since Dataverse is Open Source, you can code new visualization types, improve existing features or create new ones. We also expect contributions from the WebVR developer community and see the tool expand, improve and adapt to new standards over time. If you are a developer, you can access the github repository <a href="" target="_blank">here</a></p>
